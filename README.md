## About the Project

CampusReach is a mobile application designed to strengthen the EPFL student community by facilitating peer-to-peer support and enhancing campus life discovery. Whether you need to borrow course materials, find someone to study with, or discover spontaneous campus events, CampusReach brings students together in a trusted, campus-exclusive environment.

The app addresses a common challenge faced by university students: the difficulty of finding help or connecting with peers outside of formal channels. By creating a dedicated platform for student collaboration and event sharing, CampusReach fosters a more connected and supportive campus community.

## Core Features

###  Support Request System
Students can create and respond to various types of support requests:
- Borrow textbooks, lab equipment, calculators, or other academic materials
- Find study partners, project collaborators, or tutoring help
- Connect with students who can help based on location and availability
- Organized by academic subject, urgency, and type of assistance needed

### Interactive Campus Map
A dynamic map interface that visualizes:
- Active support requests with location markers
- Real-time updates as new requests and events are posted
- Proximity-based filtering to find nearby opportunities

###  Event Discovery & Sharing
Beyond official university events, students can:
- Share informal gatherings, study sessions, and social meetups
- Browse events by category using tag-based filtering (sports, culture, academics, social)
- Discover spontaneous activities happening across campus

###  Trust & Safety System
Building a reliable community through:
- User rating system based on completed interactions
- Reputation scores that help identify reliable peers
- Report and moderation features for maintaining community standards
- Transaction history for accountability

###  Offline Mode
Practical functionality for connectivity issues:
- View cached event listings and details
- Browse previously loaded support requests
- Access saved locations and favorite events
- Automatic sync when connection is restored
