# SwEnt M1 Team Grading Report

This first milestone M1 serves as a checkpoint at which we provide you with formal feedback on how you are coming together as a team, organizing yourselves, adopting good software engineering practices, and making progress toward delivering incremental value to your users. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The goal of our evaluation is not to assess whether you are top-tier Android developers or software testers, this will be assessed in earnest in subsequent milestones, once you've had the opportunity to gain experience and acquire the relevant skills. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M1 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md) document.

In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

## Implementation (APK, CI, tests)

We looked at whether your APK is functional and reliable. We also assessed your repo setup, whether it is clearly organized and if there is a CI running Sonar Cloud and running tests including at least one meaningful end-to-end test.

- Login does not work and we can't test the app
- There is no meaningful end-to-end test

For this part, you received 4.46 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

We assessed the structure and clarity of your Sprint and Product Backlogs and how you used them.
We looked at whether your tasks are well defined, appropriately sized, and aligned with user stories; whether the Product Backlog is well organized and value-driven; and whether the Sprint Backlog is continuously updated and demonstrates good planning and prioritization.

- in the global tabs, there is some tasks without status/labels

- you dont seem to have a consistant structure (like there is a column for PR, but only one PR has been added to it since the beginning of the project)


- you should update the current tab with sprint 3 ( we are not in sprint 2 anymore )

- your user stories has no priorities


- you could enhance by displaying the labels of the users story like you did in the global tabs but for other tabs

For this part, you received 3.75 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma

We evaluated your Figma, whether it is up-to-date with the app and how it is used as a communication, planning and design tool to accelerate the implementation of good UI.

- You need to separate the mockup from the wireframe
- For the wireframe, add some more granularity (request event section in wireframe)

For this part, you received 4 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Architecture

We reviewed your projectâ€™s architecture diagram, whether it is up-to-date with the app and if it follows clean design principles. We also looked at how it is used to discuss and document the architecture of the app as the app evolves.

- You didn't implement the architecture for future features
- You are missing data classes in your scheme
- The DB are not part of the DataLayer

For this part, you received 4 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process Documents

We reviewed your Scrum process documentation, including Sprint Retrospectives and Team Standup. We assessed whether they documented the process in detail, and how they were used to prepare the meetings. We also looked at your ability to lead structured and effective meetings, with everyone's participation.

- Documents are sometimes not completed in time
- There is one process field (sprint 2) in "What we should stop doing?" that is incomplete

- Sprint meetings are good
- You should start being more independent

For this part, you received 4.75 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Summary

Your team grade for milestone M1 is 4.21. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Good luck for the next Sprints!
